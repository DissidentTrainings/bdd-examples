# Feature Injection

* Vision: A primary or core stakeholder has a vision which will save money, make money or protect revenue.
* Goals: As well as his own goal, the goals of other stakeholders will have to be met too, in order for the vision to go live.
* Capabilities: To deliver the goal, we provide the users and the system with the capabilities to do something.
* Features: Most capabilities could be achieved with people, paper and pen, but we like to help by providing software. A feature is a widget, or a part of an application, or a page on a website, which supports the capability.
* Stories: Features are quite large, so we break them into vertical slices on which we can get feedback.
* Scenarios: A scenario is an example of a user using the system. We can use scenarios to explore the requirements, discover things we havenâ€™t thought about and break up our features and our scope.
* Code: Finally, we get to see the vision become reality!
